# DENSITY BASED TRAFFIC SIGNAL SYSTEM
# Introduction
The project is creating a density-based dynamic traffic signal system, in which the timing of the signal changes automatically in response to the density of traffic at any given intersection. In most cities throughout the world, traffic congestion is a major issue, and as a result,It's time to move away from manual mode or fixed timer mode and toward an automated system with decision-making capabilities.capabilities. The current traffic signalling system is based on a fixed time schedule, which may cause delays.If one lane is open while the others are closed, it is inefficient.

# Reasearch
Ultrasonic sensors are utilised to assess traffic density in this system. These sensors will always detect traffic on that route. The microcontroller is connected to all of these sensors.The controller detects and regulates the traffic system using these sensors.

# SWOT Analysis
![Density swot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98818208/156871631-79bc2a59-d456-4e63-b0e4-46a54c26d549.jpg)



# 4W's and 1H
### WHY
It is not necessary to wait for the other signal if there will be no traffic.
That signal will be skipped by the system, and it will move on to the next one.
### WHAT
This project will show you how to use density to control traffic.
### WHEN
When there is a lot of traffic.
Areas with a large population.
### WHERE
To control traffic automatically and effectively in high-traffic regions.
### HOW
It uses sensors and a microcontroller to automatically control traffic signals.
