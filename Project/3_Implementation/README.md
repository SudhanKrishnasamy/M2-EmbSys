# Introduction
The opposing items, or humans, can be easily spotted using this project. We merely employed the most basic sensor process here. Â The percentage of people who are blind is likely to rise in the near future. We create this ultrasonic sensor mini-process. This is a simple and low-cost product that, in comparison to other items, might be low-maintenance. This approach can be turned into a complete product, such as a Smart Glass or a walking stick.

# Reasearch
The ultrasonic sensor is attached to the spectacles, while the main unit, which contains the minimum system, power supply, and main switch, is contained in a box that the blind person can carry in his or her pocket. The technology developed by the University of Oxford is more practical and easier to use.

# SWOT Analysis


# 4W's and 1H
## WHO
This will be beneficial to both the blind and the visually impaired.
## WHAT
The primary goal of this project is to lessen the reliance of blind people on others.
## WHEN
This will come in handy for them when they walk outside and require assistance.
## WHERE
This will work in any situation.This is also effective on rainy days and in the winter.
## HOW
The ultrasonic sensor used in this project detects opposite items and sends this information to the microcontroller, which then displays the message to the user.
