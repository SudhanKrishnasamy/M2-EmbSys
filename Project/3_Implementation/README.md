# Introduction
The opposing items, or humans, can be easily spotted using this project. We merely employed the most basic sensor process here. Â The percentage of people who are blind is likely to rise in the near future. We create this ultrasonic sensor mini-process. This is a simple and low-cost product that, in comparison to other items, might be low-maintenance. This approach can be turned into a complete product, such as a Smart Glass or a walking stick.

# Reasearch
The ultrasonic sensor is attached to the spectacles, while the main unit, which contains the minimum system, power supply, and main switch, is contained in a box that the blind person can carry in his or her pocket. The technology developed by the University of Oxford is more practical and easier to use.
